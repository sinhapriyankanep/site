        <h2>About the Project</h2>
        <p> When a vehicle travels at hypersonic speeds (above Mach 5), the air in front of it gets compressed and heats up significantly due to the compression heating effect. This hot, compressed air then comes into contact with the surface of the vehicle, especially the leading edge, transferring heat to the vehicle's structure.So, the thermal protection systems and active cooling methods, are employed to manage and dissipate this heat to prevent damage to the vehicle. </p>
	I am carrying out the experiment under the supervision of Prof. Alexandros Terzis at the <a href="https://aterzis.com/">Thermo-Fluids and Interfaces Lab</a>,Technion. This project is funded by <a href="https://english.mod.gov.il/About/Innovative_Strength/Pages/Directorate-_of_Defense_Research_Development.aspx"> Maf'at</a>.
        <h2>Research Objectives</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Develop innovative methods to improve heat transfer from the vehicle's surface to the cooling system, ensuring efficient cooling at high speeds.</li>
            <li> Study the effect of liquid sheet impingement on heat transfer to optimize cooling efficiency and uniformity.</li>
            <li>Develop methods to integrate liquid sheet impingement cooling with other thermal protection systems for a comprehensive heat management solution.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Research Findings</h2>
        <p>So far, the research has revealed...</p>
        
        <h2>Future Work</h2>
        <p>Future work will focus on developing advanced models for multi-phase flow in impingement cooling systems to better understand heat transfer mechanisms and optimize coolant flow patterns.</p>
